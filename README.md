# Hello, I'm Ariunaa 👋

I'm a Junior Software Developer with a unique journey from the indigenous groups of Siberia to the bustling restaurants of New York, where I supported myself as a bartender while transitioning into tech.

My Journey
🔥 The path to learning software engineering has been painful but transformational. I embrace the process of self-teaching, continuously learning through trial and error, and leveraging resources like:

YouTube
LeetCode
Udemy
Various official documentation

My Work
👨‍💻 Over the past year, I have compiled numerous repositories featuring projects that reflect my rigorous training in JavaScript, React, Next.js, and backend development with Express servers connecting to PostgreSQL and MySQL databases.
