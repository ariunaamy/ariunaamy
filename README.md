I'm a non-traditional web developer with full-stack aspirations.  As a member of the indigenous groups in the Siberian region of Russia and a first-generation American immigrant, I value technology that provides access and opportunity, ultimately guiding us toward a sustainable future.

My path into software engineering has been painful yet energizing, as the challenges are infinite. I embrace the process of self-teaching, continuously learning through trial and error, and leveraging online resources.

Over the past year, I have compiled numerous repositories featuring projects that reflect my training in **JavaScript, React, Next.js**, and backend development with **Express** servers connecting to **PostgreSQL** and **MySQL** databases.

 ðŸ“ŒIâ€™ve highlighted the most impactful projectsâ€”please focus on these pinned repos.
