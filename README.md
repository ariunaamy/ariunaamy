I'm a non-traditional web developer with full-stack aspirations.

My journey into software engineering has been both painful and energizing. Overcoming challenges bit by bit keeps me sufficiently rewarded to remain captivated, probably forever. As a member of the indigenous groups from the Siberian region of Russia and a first-generation American immigrant, I deeply value technology that expands access and opportunity. Consequently, I find this field particularly empowering, especially with the help of open-source libraries.

 I embrace the process of self-teaching, continuously learning through trial and error, and leveraging online resources.
